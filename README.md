# no-profanity

A JavaScript package to detect and filter profanity. Yes this code, and with code I mean tests, contain profanity. But what do you expect from a test in a no-profanity package.
## Installation
```
npm i no-profanity
```
## Credit
Thanks to [bad-words](https://github.com/web-mech/badwords) for the original package. This package is a rewrite of that package, with some extra features and a lot of performance improvements.

## Usage
Using the no-profanity package is very simple. You can use it to detect profanity, or to filter profanity from a string. There are some basic options as well, such as overriding the placeholder character, or adding/removing words from the filterlist.

### Check if a string contains profanity
A basic sample showing a simple checker
```js
import { isProfane } from 'no-profanity';
console.log(isProfane("Don't be an asshole")); // true
console.log(isProfane("This is a nice text")); // false
```

### Replace profanity in a string
A basic sample showing how to replace profanities
```js
import { replaceProfanities } from 'no-profanity';
console.log(replaceProfanities("Don't be an asshole")); // Don't be an *******
console.log(replaceProfanities("This is a nice text")); // This is a nice text
```

### Get profanities from a string
A basic sample returning the profanities
```js
console.log(containsProfanities("what an asshole"));
```

Will return:
```js
[ { 
    word: 'asshole', 
    index: 8 
} ]
```

## Options
There are some overrides possible, but as soon as you want to use an override you will no longer be able pass a string to the functions defined above, but instead, they require an arguments object, like this:

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {}
});
```

### Override placeholder
 The options object should contain a property called `replacement` which should be a string of length 1, unless you want a longer replacement value as the original wordlength. The default value is `*`.

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {
        replacement: '#'
    }
});
```

### Remove words from the filterlist
The options object should contain a property called `excludes` which should be an array of strings you don't want to filter on. 

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {
        excludes: ['testable']
    }
});
```

You can also remove all words from the filter list so you can start your own, using the `emptyList` property.

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {
        emptyList: true
    }
});
```

### Add words to the filterlist
The options object should contain a property called `includes` which should be an array of strings you want to filter on. 

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {
        includes: ['testable']
    }
});
```

### Pre-sanitize the string
The options object has the option to contain a regex pattern to sanitize the string before checking for profanities. 

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "testable string",
    options: {
        preSanitize: /[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g
    }
});
```

All matches will be replaced with an empty string. If you want to change the replacement for `preSanitize`, you can use the `preSanitizeReplacement` property.

```js
replaceProfanities({
    testString: "tabs are the best",
    options: {
        preSanitizeReplacement: "spaces",
        preSanitize: /\btabs\b/,
    }
});
```

## bad-words package
This package is the replacement for the `bad-words` package which is outdated and slow. According to a handful of benchmarks, this package is about 150 times as fast. 

See also [this](other-packages.md) page for more information and the migration guide.

Most options from the `bad-words` package are usable in the `options` object to be used in this package. However, the `replaceRegex` option is not supported.
